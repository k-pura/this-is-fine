# "Things are burning down around me, but you got to smile sometimes." - KC Green

Welcome to "This Is Fine", an application where you can take all of the anxious thoughts that are lodged in your brainhole and let us hold them for you. Based on KC Green's comic that took the interwebs by storm, "This Is Fine" uses a cognitive behavioural therapy thought record model to help users recognize unhelpful thought patterns. Users are able to create an account wherein they can create new thought records and keep an index of past records.

<br/>

But, you ask, what separates “This Is Fine” from other anxiety-management apps? Here, we believe that an excellent way to turn your anxiety’s volume down is mindlessness. Yes, you read that correctly - mindlessness. Users can visit our Mindlessness for Dad jokes and random Kanye West quotes. Stay tuned for more mindless fun!
